        <p>Beatriz Andrino <br></br>This is Beatriz’s first year doing a TEDx talk. Her talk is about how she struggled with self love all throughout high school and how she’s slowly finding it. She felt very alienated and lonely throughout high school even though she had friends. She felt like talking about a struggle that she has gone through and someone out there that can relate it, is so worth while. Being a very social person yet feeling so drowned is solitude is such a lonely experience that it’s hard to put into words. Working retail and surrounding herself with activities and people that occupy her time, helped so greatly and she wanted to explain why. One of her biggest passions is film and cinema. Her favourite movies are a Clockwork Orange for it’s storyline and Lost in Translation for the meaning. The thing she loves about film, is that it’s an escape from reality and a peak into another person’s world.</p>

          <p>Emmanuel Cantiller <br></br>Emmanuel is yet another Grade 12 Student at Eric Hamber. (wowee another senior!). He loves public speaking and has taken an avid interest in the wonderful world of humanities (theater, politics, law, philosophy, history; all that b̶o̶r̶i̶n̶g̶ cool stuff). Emmanuel aspires to be a lawyer/politician and will strive to create a law that will immortalize TedX Talks in the Constitution, and make “Vancouver Great Again” by illegal-izing expensive housing.
“Community” and “Involvement” are often buzzwords when people tell you to do something other than do homework and study for tests. These buzzwords were alien to Emmanuel when he first stepped into Eric Hamber, but as the years went by he has grown to admire these aspects of the “Full High School Experience.” Emmanuel’s talk will tell his story of involvement, and he hopes this story will inspire you to create your own.

            <p>Ryan Chen <br></br>Ryan is a moderately adventurous individual. He enjoys long naps and reading books in the dark. If he is not doing those two things, he is either grooving to some music or bothering friends about their romantic excursions. Fortunately he is prepared to talk about something and not just gossip.
Ryan has always wondered why he spends so much time listening to music and reading. After careful contemplation he believes that he has come up with an answer. Well maybe… In any case, Ryan has spent way too much time reading about aesthetics and finally wants to put that knowledge to the test.
Aesthetics is the philosophy of art. Many famous philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Kant, and Hegel have spent countless hours thinking about aesthetics. Today, we live in an age where art seems to be secondary to other aspects of life. Ryan will try to convince you that we should spend more time on it. If not that, he will try to convince you that it is worth your money.

          <p>Olivia Cho <br></br>Olivia is currently a graduating student at Eric Hamber Secondary School. Having struggled greatly in arriving at her decision to be a cellist, this TEDx talk is a meaningful opportunity for Olivia to share her passion and address the stigma around pursuing music. In addition to playing the cello, Olivia is fascinated by the synergy that arises from multiple and contrasting disciplines. She enjoys doing calligraphy, graphic design, and reading Webtoons for leisure. A firm supporter of social responsibility, Olivia serves as her school’s Student Council President, leads the Healing Harmonies Club in performing at local senior homes, volunteers as a Media & Publicity Coordinator at her church, and mentors younger cellists whenever she has the chance. She hopes that her presentation will prompt others to consider the profound importance music can hold in an individual life and our larger society.

          <p>Daniel Ta<br></br>Out of all the individuals that could have been chosen, Daniel is probably the most average and under-qualified to be a speaker. However, Daniel believes that relatability and humour will allow him to connect to the audience in a way those far superior than him cannot.<br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br></p>
