    Can anyone attend as an audience member?
  </h1>
    <p class=text>
      Everyone is welcome to apply as an attendee for the event! An application process is required for ALL that wish to attend. Due to the limit on the number of attendees we can have, only those selected will be able to attend the event. For this reason, preference will be given to those closely involved with the Hamber community--Hamber students, alumni, parents, and teachers/staff members!

    Why do I need to fill out an application in order to attend?
  </h2>
    <p class=text>
      Due to TEDx conference guidelines, this event will have a maximum of 100 attendees. The attendee application will ensure that there will be a diverse Hamber audience present at the event--who are all passionate about ideas worth spreading!<br></br>
  The Planning Team is looking for enthusiastic applicants who are committed to attending the event and also interested in sharing knowledge beyond the conference. The audience members are just as important as the speakers and performers on stage!
