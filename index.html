    What is TED?
  </h1>
      <p class=text>
        TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.
        <br></br>
        The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

    Clarity
  </h2>
      <p class=text>
        Clarity is the clearness and lucidity of our perception—a precise, unfiltered state of mind. It is a lens that focuses out the soft edges of ambiguity to reveal the world as it is. We are often lost in indistinctness and trapped in a narrow world view. As we progress through our lives and gain invaluable experiences, our lens widens and sharpens. We are able to capture a panoramic view of our reality. Clarity is not something gifted to us, but gained through experience, insight and empathy. Our TEDx speakers each have their own experiences to share, a small piece of their story.  Each has widened their lens a bit more—and hope their talks can have the same effect on the audience.
